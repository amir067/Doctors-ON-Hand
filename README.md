## Future Work

 - User application will have a online payment service where user can pay using credit or debit card services
 - User application can have a recommendation algorithm which will recommend medicines or products based on the user's purchase history
 - Medical store can limit purchase of a particular user to a limited quantity per user  
 - We will keep a feedback form or ratings option about a particular product
 - User can cancel the product by giving appropriate reason and if the store owner agrees he will refund the money
 - User can chat with the store owner regarding the product or any issues regarding the product
 

All these functionalities would polish the application if we had more time to implement it
